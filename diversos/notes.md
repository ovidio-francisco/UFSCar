Language Model
--------------

+ A topic in a document or query can be represented as a language model
	- i.e., words that tend to occur often when discussing a topic will have high probabilities in the corresponding language model
+ Multinomial distribution over words
	- text is modeled as a finite sequence of words, where there are t possible words at each point in the sequence
	- commonly used, but not only possibility
	- doesnâ€™t model burstiness
